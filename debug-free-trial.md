# Free Trial Debug Report

## Issues Found:

### 1. **Database Plan Missing**
- The `plans` table might be missing the `free_trial` plan
- Need to verify `vapi_assistant_id` is set for free_trial plan

### 2. **Eligibility Check Race Condition**
- User eligibility is checked twice (frontend + backend)
- Could cause race conditions

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Generic error messages don't help identify specific issues
- Need better logging

## Common User Issues:

### A. "Free trial not available" 
- User already used free trial in last 24 hours
- Database plan missing

### B. "Call initiation failed"
- VAPI assistant ID missing for free_trial plan
- Account concurrency limit reached

### C. "Failed to create booking"
- Database constraint violations
- User upsert failures

## Fixes Needed:

1. Add database plan verification
2. Improve error messages
3. Add debug logging
4. Fix race conditions

## Next Steps:

1. Check plans table data
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Test free trial flow end-to-end
